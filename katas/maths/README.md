Instructions
============

Given a mathematical expression as a string you must return the result as a number.

Numbers
-------

Number may be both whole numbers and/or decimal numbers. The same goes for the returned result.

Operators
---------

You need to support the following mathematical operators:

  - Addition `+`
  - Subtraction `-`
  - Multiplication `*`
  - Division `/`

Operators are always evaluated from left-to-right, and `*` and `/` must be evaluated before `+` and `-`.

Parentheses
-----------

You need to support multiple levels of nested parentheses, ex. `(2 / (2 + 3.33) * 4) - -6`

Whitespace
----------

There may or may not be whitespace between numbers and operators. However the minus sign attached to negative numbers (`-`) will never be separated by whitespace.

Validation
----------

You do not need to worry about validation - you will only receive valid mathematical expressions following the above rules.

Eval
----

Both `eval` and `Function` are disabled.
